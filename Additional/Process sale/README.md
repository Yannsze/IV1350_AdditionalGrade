# Point of Sale System (IV1350 Additional Higher Grade)

This project is part of the course **IV1350 - Object-Oriented Design**, specifically for **Additional Higher Grade**. It represents a simplified **Point of Sale (POS)** system implemented in Java. The system follows object-oriented principles with a focus on clean architecture, low coupling, and high cohesion.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main tasks:

### Task 1 – Inheritance

- Use Template Method design pattern that follows the pseudocode provided.
  - The structure with
    the try-catch block and the abstract methods must remain unchanged.

### Task 2 – Inheritance vs Composition
- To adapt any class in the java libraries from Oracle, except a list.
- Write one new class that adapts using inheritance, and another new class that adapts
  using composition. 
  - For this project, java.util.Random was used.

### Task 3 – Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for all methods that print to System.out
